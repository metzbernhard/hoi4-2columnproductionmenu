# Hearts of Iron 4 Bigger Production Menu (Two Production Columns)

Mod for Paradox Grand Strategy Game Hearts of Iron IV:https://steamcommunity.com/app/394360

Mod in the Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756002034

Not much to say, shows two production rows in the production menu (and relocates the window for new productions respectively) so you can see more productions at a time since I find the standard production menu a little lacking in terms of Overview. 

Have fun with, should be Ironman compatible and not interfere with any mods as long as they don't change anything in the military production interface (haven't seen one yet) 

Needs a resolution with at least 1440px width. 

Three coloumn version for 1920 width resolutions: steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756097675 

(Changenote #1: fixed Naval Deployment Window, thank you NicaEM for your bugreport!)
